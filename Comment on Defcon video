I just watched a video on "Cyber Murder." The government has a Server that holds all information about deceased people.
It is called the Electronic Death Registration System. This allows doctors and funeral directors to input information about your death on the database.
An Australian man found a flaw in this database and he can technically kill people in 10-15 minutes!
This is absolutely insane, I couldn't imagine trying to go out and eat somewhere or get pulled over and they search my record and nothing shows up or it shows im deceased.
I think this issue was fixed recently but holy cow, I would be freaking out if this flaw in the system wasn't fixed asap. 
This would and could cause a huge problem for whoever the victim is for weeks to come.
