I think I would make a Crowd Funding Idea on how to "correctly type." I would try to inform people of using the "home row keys" so that they aren't having to look at their keyboard as they type.
I guess it just bugs me when people are staring at their keyboard or typing using two fingers. 
Thats what bought about this idea and for the deliverables, People might actually learn how to use the home row and not have to look at their keyboard to see if they're hitting the correct keys.
