Data Normalization problems occur when you break the following rules.
1. Repeating data groups
2. Multiple uses of the same attribute
3. Multiple occurences of the same fact
4. Conflicting facts
5. Missing Information

Repeating data groups goes against First Normal Form. Which means you entered in repeating data within the first two columns
Basically normalization problems occur when you break the First Normal Form, Second Normal Form, Third Normal Form, and BCNF.
