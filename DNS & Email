The DNS (Domain Name Service/System) is a naming system that is connected to the internet or a private network. The bluntest version of DNS is that DNS basically associates names such as (www.google.com) with 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4. This allows us to type in the name and it will automatically assign your request or set of information to that wbsite. If DNS didn't exist, I think you'd find everybody typing in IP addresses to get to their destination and without this little protocol or feature, you woudln't find the internet as easy and popular as it is today.
Email is basically Electronic mail. It's put in a digital container and sent to another user. Email today has a system where you send an email, an email server accepts, forwards, delivers, and store's messages. Neither the sender or recipient of the email have to be online at the same time.

Don't mind me. I am just here for today's homework.
