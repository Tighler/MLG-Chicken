I would like to make a Steak. 
I would hope to get some sort of funding and I think I would make it available for people to give me ingedient choices that I could use to make the steak.
It would be a fun idea to see how the Steak comes out and tastes!
The deliverables would be having a large audience all delivering to a small peice of a steak, I would be able to provide a picture of the outcome, and also provide details of how the steak tasted whether it was bad or good.
